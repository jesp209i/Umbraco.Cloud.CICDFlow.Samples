# Umbraco Cloud CICD Flow Samples
Scripts and pipeline samples for the CI/CD Flow feature on Umbraco Cloud.

> The Scripts are provided as is. This means that the scripts will do the bare minimum for a pipeline that is utilizing the CI/CD flow.
> They can be integrated into your own pipelines so they will have the ability to do deployments to your Umbraco Cloud projects.

We have scripts that target our V1 and V2 endpoints. 

For new users we recommend using V2 scripts. You can still find the V1 scripts below.

## PowerShell V2 scripts
You can use the same PowerShell scripts for Github and Azure Devops.

- [Github Actions using Powershell Scripts](/V2/powershell/github/readme.md)
- [Azure DevOps using Powershell Scripts](/V2/powershell/azuredevops/readme.md)

## Bash V2 scripts
You can use the same Bash scripts for Github and Azure Devops.
