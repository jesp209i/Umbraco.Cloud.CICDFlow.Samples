# Umbraco Cloud CICD Flow Samples
Scripts and pipeline samples for the CI/CD Flow feature on Umbraco Cloud.

The Scripts are provided as is. This means that the scripts will do the bare minimum for a pipeline that is utilizing the CI/CD flow.
The idea is that they can be integrated into your own pipelines so they will have the ability to do deployments to your Umbraco Cloud projects.
